# New-York-Airbnb-Data-Analytics-and-Price-Prediction
Overview
This project involves data analysis and prediction modeling using the New York Airbnb dataset. The goal is to perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, text processing, and build a prediction model using machine learning techniques.

Objectives
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Clean the dataset and analyze key patterns in the data related to factors such as pricing, availability, reviews, etc.
Data Visualization: Create informative visualizations to reveal insights from the dataset using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Text Processing: Apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to process and analyze review texts, focusing on sentiment analysis and keyword extraction.
Model Building: Implement machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest or other regression techniques, to predict Airbnb pricing or availability.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language
Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning
Matplotlib / Seaborn: Data visualization
Scikit-learn: Machine learning model development
NLTK / SpaCy: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive development
